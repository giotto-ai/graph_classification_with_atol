# Graph classification with Automatic Topologically-Oriented Learning

In this repository we expolore the ATOL method for automatic feature generation for persistence diagrams (ATOL: Automatic Topologically-Oriented Learning). It is based on Martin Royer's [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.13472.pdf) and makes use of  the corresponding [source code](https://github.com/martinroyer/atol)(copyright INRIA). Have a look at our [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/from-cutting-edge-research-to-industrial-applications-with-giotto-c5657a4450de) for more information.

We also adapt the Perslay [codebase](https://github.com/MathieuCarriere/perslay) to match the API from giotto-tda.


## Requirements
  * giotto-tda
  * scikit-learn
  * joblib
  * numpy
  * GUDHI
 
 ## Notebook overview
 The notebook contains an example of usage for the ATOL layer. We apply it 
 to a graph classification problem and results are comparable to 
 state-of-the-art algorithms. 
 
 ## Data
 The dataset we use in the notebook comes from from moleculenet.ai 
 and it is called ClinTox. It contains 1478 drugs molecules labelled in 2 classes: 
 toxic and safe.
 
 ## Getting Started
 Since we are going to use packages from both pip and conda you should have 
 [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/?gclid=Cj0KCQiAvJXxBRCeARIsAMSkApqg-qkK5wu2lEGCutGt3Oy0j2GT21HsFtmPyD6Il6VhOVKbPnNM_y8aAu3qEALw_wcB) 
 installed. 
 
 Then, in order to run the notebook you should follow these steps:
 
 - Create a new environment with the needed packages
 
 ``conda env create -f environment.yml``

 - Activate the environment
 
 ``conda activate atol-env``
 
 Now you should be able to run the notebook! 
 
 Enjoy :)
